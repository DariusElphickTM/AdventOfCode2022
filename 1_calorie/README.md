Notes

* Caveat: Used VSCode find and replace to shape the puzzle input for a string to a matrix. Couldn't be arsed to do that through code.
* Task is accomplishable using only JS Array API functions and callbacks.
* Relatively simple combination of reduce, and realising that the order doesn't matter so I could sort the array and pop off the top.
* Test driven development is my preferred methodology. Write a test for the example, get the test to pass with the implementation, and then run the puzzle input through it to get the correct answer.
